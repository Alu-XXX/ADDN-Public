# ADDN-Public

The algorithm is based on continuous relaxation and gradient descent in architecture space. It is able to efficiently design high-performance knowledge distillation network architectures and has been used for image classification (such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet). Only a single GPU is required.

## Requirements
```
Python >= 3.5.5, PyTorch == 0.3.1, torchvision == 0.2.0
```

## Datasets
CIFAR-10/100、TinyImageNet、ImageNet-1K、ImageNet
